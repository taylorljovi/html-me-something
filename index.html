        <h2>Ocho Rios</h2>
         <p>Excursion number one was one to put in the books!</p>
         <p>We had the chance to do a four pack excursion where we got to explore Dunns River Falls, zip-line, four wheel, and horse back ride.</p>

       <h3>Zip-Lining</h3>
       <p>First, we climbed up a tree with our gear on to get ready to latch our selves to a wire so that we would zip-line. Below our dangling legs were these beautiful waterfalls leading out to the ocean. Going station to station we got to either jump or get pushed if you did not have the guts to let go yourself. </p>

       <h3>Dunns River Falls</h3>
        <p>After zip-lining to the bottom of the falls, we got to explore The Dunns River Falls that we had just flown over. This was a once in a life time experience. You climb from level to level gradually going up the falls till you reach the top. While you are going up the falls there are small pools of water where you can take a rest and relax and soak in the mineral water.</p>

        <h3>LUNCH!</h3>
       <p>We were at the farm where we were headed to jump on the back of some major horse power, but first lunch was upon us. Lucky us we got to experience Jamaicas best, some Jerk Chicken and rice and beans.</p>

        <h3>Fourwheeling</h3>
       <p>After lunch, it was time to strap up and put our helmets on and explore the land on some ATV's. Each person got their own fourwheeler, we got to explore this beautiful tropical farm land with 4 wheel drive vehicles which were capable to take us to beautiful places and isolated remote areas some of which can only be accessed by off-road vehicles. Our last stop on the journey was a cliff in to 25 feet deep crystal clear water. Only be most brave took the chance to jump off thes 15 foot jump. </p>

        <h3>Horse Back Riding</h3>
       <p>Last but not least, after all the crazy adventures we got to go on a relaxing horse back ride. Well my husband and I own horses back home, so we went on a little crazier of a ride than the others. Sturring up our horses we kept up with the guides galloping through the palm trees and onto beaches.. </p>
