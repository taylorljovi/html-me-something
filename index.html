       <p>Excursion number one was one to put in the books!</p>
       <p>We had the chance to do a four pack excursion where we got to explore Dunns River Falls, zip-line, four wheel, and horse back ride.</p>
       <p>First, we climbed up a tree with our gear on to get ready to latch our selves to a wire so that we would zip-line. Below our dangling legs were these beautiful waterfalls leading out to the ocean. Going station to station we got to either jump or get pushed if you did not have the guts to let go yourself. </p>
       <p>After zip-lining to the bottom of the falls, we got to explore The Dunns River Falls that we had just flown over. This was a once in a life time experience. You climb from level to level gradually going up the falls till you reach the top. While you are going up the falls there are small pools of water where you can take a rest and relax and soak in the mineral water.</p>
       <p>We were at the farm where we were headed to jump on the back of some major horse power, but first lunch was upon us. Lucky us we got to experience Jamaicas best, some Jerk Chicken and rice and beans.</p>
       <p>After lunch, it was time to strap up and put our helmets on and explore the land on some ATV's.  </p>
       <p>Last, </p>
